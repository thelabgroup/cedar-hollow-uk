/*
 * theoaks.uk -- the old Oxford site, forwarded to cedarhollow.uk. And
 * theoaks.co.uk, which showed the same Wix site, the same way.
 *
 * theoaks.uk was Cedar Hollow Oxford's site, built on Wix, until October
 * 2026. Every page on it has an equivalent here, and this Worker answers
 * every request for the old domain -- either host, http or https -- with one
 * permanent redirect to that equivalent's canonical address. One hop, to the
 * exact final URL: Google advises against redirect chains in a site move, and
 * every extra hop is another fetch for every crawler.
 *
 * It is its own Worker, not part of worker/index.js, attached to theoaks.uk
 * and www.theoaks.uk as custom domains, so nothing here can affect
 * cedarhollow.uk. Mail to @theoaks.uk is not involved: that is the zone's MX
 * records, which still point at Google Workspace.
 *
 * Keep it running for years. Search Console's Change of Address carries the
 * old site's standing across for 180 days, Google's site-move guide says to
 * keep redirects for at least a year, and bookmarks, old reviews and printed
 * cards point at theoaks.uk for far longer than either. The domain is
 * registered at names.co.uk until June 2028.
 *
 * Deploying: Cloudflare dashboard > Workers & Pages > theoaks-redirect >
 * Edit code, paste this file over what is there, Deploy. Then run
 *
 *   python scripts/check-theoaks-redirects.py
 *
 * which fetches every old address on both hosts, over http and https, and
 * fails on anything that is not a single 301 to a live page.

/*
 * Every address in Wix's sitemaps at the move, as it is matched: lower case,
 * no trailing slash. Each target is that page's canonical URL on
 * cedarhollow.uk, never an address that redirects again.
 *
 * Most pages kept their slug under /oxford/. Of the rest, the shop and the
 * three 3D-tour pages (vr, vr2 and copy-of-map) go where their /oxford/ twins
 * go in public/_redirects, the Oxford home page, and copy-of-facilities --
 * Wix's Vouchers page, never renamed -- goes to the Oxford retreats, since
 * vouchers are due to return as part of booking a stay.
 *
 * Strict JSON (double quotes, no trailing comma), so the check script can
 * read it straight out of this file.
